# MajorProject2023

Welcome to MajorProject2023 repository! This repository contains all the work related to our final year project, which focuses on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies.

## Project Overview

Our project, named GreenWave: The Smart Traffic Router, is aimed at optimizing vehicle routing at traffic signals using advanced technologies. Here's a brief overview of the project:

- **Live Video Streaming Application**: We have developed a live video streaming web application that forms the backbone of our traffic optimization system.
- **Optimal Timing Prediction**: Using machine learning algorithms, we predict the optimal timing for green signals at traffic intersections.
- **Reduced Waiting Time**: By implementing our solution, we aim to significantly reduce the average waiting time for vehicle owners at traffic signals.
- **Minimized Carbon Footprint**: One of the key benefits of our project is the reduction in carbon footprint associated with minimized idle time at traffic signals.

## Video Demonstration
